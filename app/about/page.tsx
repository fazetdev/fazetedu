        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Fazet Edu was created to support schools in Northern Nigeria, particularly
          in Kano and the North-West, where many schools still rely on paper
          registers, spreadsheets, and WhatsApp messages to manage students,
          teachers, and academic activities.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          Unlike other regions that already have advanced SMS systems and
          digital school management platforms, many schools here face challenges
          such as unreliable communication, missing student data, and inefficient
          reporting processes.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our platform provides **affordable, simple, and practical tools**
          designed for the realities of Northern schools. From student management,
          attendance tracking, and report generation to helping teachers earn extra
          income through <strong>TeacherEarn</strong> and access resources via
          <strong> EduMarket</strong>, Fazet Edu is built to work with local constraints.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          The system is **mobile-friendly**, works with low-tech environments, and
          is easy for school administrators and teachers to adopt without
          extensive training.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
          Our mission is simple: help Northern schools transition from paper to
          digital, improve school management, and create new income opportunities
          for teachers.
        </p>
  
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-6">
          *Fazet Edu is currently in pilot phase with select schools in Kano and the
          North-West, gathering feedback to ensure practical solutions for every
          school.*
